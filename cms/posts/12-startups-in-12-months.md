A couple of weeks ago, as I was listening to an Indie Hackers podcast, and the 12 startups in 12 months challenge came up. Jon Yongfook was discussing what he got out of the challenge and how it eventually helped him build Banner Bear. It really sparked my interest. 

The challenge was made popular by [Pieter Levels back in 2014](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/). I have came across other people on Twitter who have done the same thing before, but it's never really caught my interest until now, and I'm not sure why.

I've decided I'm going to do it, and document it all.

## Why do this?

I am officially labeling myself as a 'wantraprenuer'. I listen to podcasts and read books and articles about solo founding, but never actually start. I also have a horrible time of actually finishing projects. I'm super about starting them, but want to practice and learn how to finish. So I'm hoping through this challenge, I develop a better understanding of the whole lifecycle and learn how to motivate myself to finish projects.

## My main goal

I have one very clear goal for this challenge, and that is to finish it. A huge secondary goal would be to get at least one person to pay any amount of money. However my main goal for myself, is to have launched 12 projects after 12 months.
