A couple of weeks ago I was listening to an Indie Hackers podcast, and the 12 startups in 12 months challenge came up. Jon Yongfook was discussing the challenge and how it eventually helped him build Banner Bear. It really sparked my interest. 

The challenge was made popular by [Pieter Levels back in 2014](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/). I have came across other people on Twitter who have done the same thing before, but it's never really dawned on me to try, until now.

I've decided I'm going to do it and document it all starting July 1, 2021.

## Why do this?

I listen to podcasts and read books and articles about solo founding, but never actually start. I also have a horrible time of actually finishing projects. I'm super about starting them, but want to practice and learn how to finish. So I'm hoping through this challenge, I develop a better understanding of the whole lifecycle and learn how to motivate myself to finish projects.

## My main goal

I have one very clear goal for this challenge, and that is to finish it. A huge secondary goal would be to get at least one person to pay any amount of money. However my main goal for myself, is to have launched 12 projects after 12 months.

## Keeping myself on track and motivated

I often find myself struggling to find the motivation to hop on my computer after dinner, getting the baby to bed, hanging out with my wife, doing the dishes, etc. It's always just so easy to open a beer and turn on a show. 

I'm really wanting to make a habit of working smaller bits of time more often, than trying to grind out huge tasks in a one weekend binge kind of situation.

All of my projects will be separate blog posts, and I'm going to make myself comment on them frequently, even if progress is low. I want to be able to look back at the history and my thinking. I'm almost going to treat this as a journal.

## Current startup schedule

Here is my current plan as of writing this (July 1, 2021). I will update these links below with the projects as they are created.
