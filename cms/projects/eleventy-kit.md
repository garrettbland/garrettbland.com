Some websites that I build, never end up needing too much javascript. [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is a great tool to quickly build out websites and generate a static site. 

I use a lot of the same tools throughout each project, so I put together this template. [Click here (https://eleventykit.netlify.app/)](https://eleventykit.netlify.app/) to check out Eleventy Kit!

You can read more about it above, but basically I packed in the following.

* Eleventy
* TailwindCSS
* Alpine JS
* Live Browser Reloading
* Minifies & removes unused css styles
* Minified JS, HTML, and CSS
* No complicated configs! :)

I've even put together a few packages to add native lazy loading to images, and to also validate that images have an \`alt\` tag for accessibility and SEO benefits. Check those out below.
