# Next Kit

At Eagle I setup a lot of new sites. Pretty much every site has the same setup that I use with everyone as a starting point. I setup my ideal template using NextJS and Tailwind, and named it ever-so-elegantly, Next Kit [https://nextkit.netlify.app/](https://nextkit.netlify.app/)

If you want to poke around the template github repo, it lives at [https://github.com/garrettbland/next-kit](https://github.com/garrettbland/next-kit)
