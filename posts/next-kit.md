# Next Kit

At Eagle I setup a lot of new sites. Pretty much every site has the same setup that I use with everyone as a starting point. I setup my ideal template using NextJS and Tailwind, and named it ever-so-elegantly, [Next Kit](https://nextkit.netlify.app/)

If you want to poke around the template github repo, it lives at [https://github.com/garrettbland/next-kit](https://github.com/garrettbland/next-kit)

### Features

Next Kit comes with all the cool stuff that I love and use daily. It saves me a bit of time and headache each time with these.

-   Next JS
-   TailwindCSS
-   PostCSS
-   Typescript
-   Typography Tailwind Plugin
-   Prettier (and my own config below)

```json
{
    "semi": false,
    "bracketSpacing": true,
    "singleQuote": true,
    "printWidth": 100,
    "tabWidth": 4,
    "trailingComma": "es5"
}
```
